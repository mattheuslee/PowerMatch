# PowerMatch
A high-power matcher class that performs different levels of matching for strings.

## Requirements:
C++11
If using g++, this has been tested on g++ 5.4.0. PowerMatch requires `<regex>`, which is only reportedly working properly in g++ 4.9.2 onwards.

## Examples:
An example of the basic usage of PowerMatch can be found in `test.cpp`.
